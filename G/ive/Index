       $expr for some -eight**
        via -expr parsing @8 means %togcon:1
        $pt restricts it to $p-four
     
    it can name '-four':
      $t/$expr:'-four'%togcon:2/$ok
       $expr targets -four (some $eight**c&pi|.t)
       %togcon:2 meaning $expr/** is a %togcon index,
        starting beyond $pt, guessed for $expr to be:
         the main pointering thing inside -four, ie:
       expanding to:
      $t/$expr:'-four'%togcon:1/$pt:'beginning-four-brackology-ology<-gate'/$ok
       for applying the meaning
       the main $pt for $expr now stated inside it,
        so we can serve &togcon for %togcon=$expr/*/*
     
      how to paint the path
       as ending in a portrait
     $pt may:
       be a loose pointer
        eg '-four', as above
        eg q/-four*-grouptri/
        would be explicit enough to start a -grouptri,
         as discovered to be a -group* thing
          and put in with that lot while -four
     $ok may:
       also loose pointer
        eg q/e*Lingo/ 
         matching $ok='e,r,on,gate_r_Lingo'
         each $ok tried, expected
          see 'test data would clue surprise unfurlments'
       which could compress to /^e.*Lingo$/ (knowing all $ok)
        to be as ambiguous as possible,
         since the -eight that -four goes into is expected
       include ok%pt, to move into that %togcon/$pt/$ok
         doesnt make sense for %togcon.$pt.$ok
        a way to include a freak in a pile of others
        # probably for a different puzzle
      when
       .$ok - have some kind of data here
        ie the $ope, or compatible projects'' stuff joint()ed somehow
       /$ok - have anything on that C
       
    movable meaning zones:
     so $t/$expr
     and %togcon/$pt/$ok
      or $expr%togcon:2/$ok
      or $t%togcon/$expr/$ok
     (gets $pt from $expr)
        
     can be placed so $t/... needs differentiate:
     
     can entirely sc jampack %togcon={...}
       Lines peel deeply? splits chunk of yaml if large
     or exude into C-space:
      $t%togcon.$pt.$ok=ope
        room in $t%*/**
      $t%togcon /$expr       /$ok=ope  or:
      $t    /$expr%togcon:2  /$ok=ope  or:
      $t    /$expr%togcon2.$ok=ope     or even:
      $t    /$expr%togcon.$pt.$ok=ope
      $t    /$expr%togcon/$pt/$ok=ope
        are variously jammed, sizo determines best?
        get $pt for $expr, etc
         have to state all $pt (the last two ^)
          if not the one $pt for $expr
     even going as far as
      $t/$expr:togcon@8/$pt/$ok
       # named after the index it is (becomes $expr%togcon)
      $t/$expr:something%togcon:2/$ok
       since they could be anything,
       apply to all|certain other possible $expr that can %togcon
     or being minimal, loosely exudey:
      $t%togcon2.$ok=ope/$expr
        know %togcon2 is %togcon:2,
         starting ahead of its first column (many $expr)
        so $pt/$ok for all $expr,
        eg turn up the volume knob on certain things
      $t%togcon2.$ok=ope
        so $pt/$ok for any possible $expr
        eg turn up the volume knob on everything
     
    $expr is treated -expr
        could bind to one (maybe more) possible $expr,
         a place to hang details for all those $expr,
          ie $pt/$ok for all $expr
           $ok probably ignored by another $pt it is shared to,
            if those -whatevers are wildly different
           or:
            finds the same thing
             immersed in a different web
           it might have a number of %matches to expect,
            or the test data would clue surprise unfurlments
           then decide when to:
         sometimes be specific which styles apply to what
          subnet of the tree to start inheriting $x from
          < can css do .thermal ^^^(!hot|cooled) { cool }?
        ...
        could be supplemental,
         refer to any $expr, maybe anything,
          check some other dimension of sense across them
          etc.
        could be anything
          hoping to resolve in this Story
       arbitrary name and content, implied normal:
        given expr.t
         ~'-four': bind to c&pi == 'four'
         ~'togcon': make expr%togcon=1
           named for the index it carries
            maybe thats what @8 means?
           that it is Cified (scanned) %togcon
            to be put back together
