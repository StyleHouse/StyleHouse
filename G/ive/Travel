          may bring other users around,
           eg self must instantiate an O others want to be
          may be streaming somewhere
           eg brack rows upwards
           to fill indexes (merge branches), think on O
           similar to the slep landscape joinup and %%eto:1 hoisting
           getting extra %%O as the row leaves
        
        anyway,
        here, self visits Ying/*/* into O=Rc&s,
         which starts R/**%Nodaring we can tunnel/sleep
         as a kind of R%Nodar self tour
          usu there is a similar canonical other tour
          eg %Abodis others regularly to keep watch for ~self,
           as well as apply styles
         re-visiting parts of the self is elvised|tunneled from users:
        
        other
         visits anything as anything else,
          supposing self is complete (eg Display attached)
          so we can work some other process into it:
         knowing the self + others at O,
          a chance to slep and elvis any of them
          eg new/gone/diff 4/* can be noticed by any othering near it
         other may:
          bring inputs to slep themselves (see -balcurve)
          find selfs that should be because $s..$z
           stretching self beyond its starting shape,
            may have dim O between $s..$z, if never iterated (!node)
          include etc in the R:Nodar self tour
          
         self gc:
           when self wants to O/-O,
            other the effect of being gently phased out first
           %eph may $s/!$z, need to look in sy&R X-path to gc
         
         eg
           a node happening, wanting sy&Org
           making its language there happen
           eg blinking lights, looking %ope, incrementing time
         eg
           to express another thing through it
           showing several -seven in -balcurve/-seven/-n
            would be given to Nodar by the %Plot
            -n+ each knowing an O to style
           specifics|activity amplified across a bell curve,
            the intensity smoothly fading
            so the middle seems to burn open
           -balcurve would slep, like another self
            who in turn is othering its parameters
             which may self from some html controls
             and how they might interslep
            depending on the -balcurve resolving via other,
             may need different attention
              depending on its futurism
              eg being a %J native to another %J
             winding Y:pi cv-ov gaps should do (when !%J)
         
         so,
         may elvis for selfing if slep clued from other
