usu paint is working loose to tight,
 or tightly scooting around in a few details,
  not loosening far enough to cover the whole thing
work out two use cases at a time
 same channels, different cause
dome envelopes
 thing reuse linkages
  as rowspanning left border brackety things?
 the roundness scale

=vectoria

regrouping by non-$n
 pie charts that hold a peace sign shape
  assign an age at each boundary
   for festival crowd analysis

to get:
 foreground objects - bitmap cutouts
 > background in-fill
  tiling/reflect-stretch the background
   in: across the hole the foreground leaves
   out: off the edges of the image,
    continuing lines outward,
    esp finding a horizon, joining that sensibly

bitmap -> svg:
 https://github.com/jankovicsandras/imagetracerjs
line/shape -> locating: 
 http://paperjs.org/reference/shape/#intersects-item
 http://paperjs.org/reference/pathitem/#getintersections-path
  then pull apart shapes until the exact line
reflect-stretch the background:
 ?

the edgy image pile:
 clip to shapes near the edge

    house was the first artifact by the animals
      (nest building is happening all around us)
     somewhere different, beyond the wider doomscape.
     the bump on the landscape.
      thing against nothing.
     defines an inside, so io.
     has states and layers, so ego death.
    style is info, the top level
     fully receptive, connective.
     the light from the machine.
