to get:
 foreground objects - bitmap cutouts
 > background in-fill
  tiling/reflect-stretch the background
   in: across the hole the foreground leaves
   out: off the edges of the image,
    continuing lines outward,
    esp finding a horizon, joining that sensibly

bitmap -> svg:

line/shape -> locating: 
 http://paperjs.org/reference/shape/#intersects-item
 http://paperjs.org/reference/pathitem/#getintersections-path
  then pull apart shapes until the exact line
reflect-stretch the background:
 ?

the edgy image pile:
 clip to shapes near the edge

     somewhere different, beyond the wider doomscape.
     the bump on the landscape.
      thing against nothing.
     defines an inside, so io.
     has states and layers, so ego death.
    style is info, the top level
     fully receptive, connective.
     the light from the machine.
