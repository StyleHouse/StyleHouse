evaluation procedure designed to select the optimal grammar for given data, within the format determined by Universal Grammar (UG), the theory of the biological endowment of the relevant components of the faculty of language (FL).
an abstract language acquisition device
Any complication of UG poses barriers to some eventual account of the evolution of FL. 2 There is, then, an additional and compelling reason to seek the simplest formulation of UG, eliminating stipulations, redun- dancy, and other complications
how can a system such as human language arise in the mind/brain ... ? ” The problem is no doubt a significant one. To address it seriously, one must satisfy two elementary conditions. The first is to deter- mine as best one can the nature of the phenotype — that is, what has evolved, namely FL. One must begin with the most satisfactory version of UG. No biologist, for example, would present a proposal about the evolution of the eye without presenting a clear account — preferably, the best available one — of what an eye is. That is close to a truism, as is the second condition: pay atten- tion to the empirical evidence about the origin of language.
There are two empirical theses about the origin of language.
One, established with considerable confidence, is that there has been little if any evolution of FL since our ancestors left Africa, some 50,000 – 80,000 years ago. The second, proposed with fair confidence, is that not long before this, there is no reason to believe that language existed at all (Tattersall 2012). If so, then FL emerged suddenly (in evolutionary time), and we would expect it to be quite simple, its basic properties largely determined by laws of nature and by extralinguistic contingencies. Since language is clearly a com- putational system, the relevant laws of nature should include (and perhaps be limited to) principles of efficient computation.
